        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The following details the history of the OSMKKF.</p>
        <h3>History on Continental Asia</h3>
        <p>It is believed that the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, who traveled to China in 527 BCE. There he taught the Shaolin monks the Indian art of <i>Vajramushti</i>, where it would continue to develop. Eventually, travelers from China would intorduce their martial art under the Shao lin name (少林), which was pronounced as "Shorin ryu" from the same characters. There it would develop into its own art yet again.</p>
        <h3>Pre-empirical History</h3>
        <p>There were many styles of <i>te</i>, as it was then known, based on the cities they were developed in. The main three styles, Shuri-te, Naha-te, and Tomari-te, eventually gave birth to Shorin-ryu (Shuri and Tomari combination) and Shorei-ryu (Naha). Shorin-ryu is a very direct, linear style, whiel Shorei-ryu was developed to utilize the breathing best associated with specific techniques.<br>
        When the Three Kingdoms merged to form Ryukyu in the 15th Century, all weapons ownership, as well as any martial arts practice, was banned. This developed the <i>kobudo</i> system, which utilized household items and common weapons. </p>
        <h3>Meiji Restoration</h3>
        <p>Through the mid-1800s, Okinawa was in turmoil as the old Samurai ways died out and the Emperor once again still ruled. All of the previous nobility were truned into commoners, subjecting them to the hostilities of the people they once ruled over. Sokon Bushi Matsumura, a former military officer, developed a hard style focused on rendering opponents unconscious in a few strikes. They originally trained thee years in secret on each kata, as well as practicing makiwara. Sparring in its modern form did not exist, instead they would simply challenge each other to test their skills.</p>
        <h3>Lineage of Masters</h3>
        <h4>Sakugawa Kanga</h4>
        <p>Sokugawa studied for 6 years under Ryukyuan monk Pichin Takahara. On reccomendation, he then studied under Kusanku, and Chinese kung fu master. He returned to Ryukyu in 1762 to begin teaching, where he met Matsumura Sokon, who would continue the development of the style.</p>
        <h4>Matsumura Sokon</h4>
        <p>Matsumura started training at a young age, when he was regarded as a bit of a troublemaker. He was later recruited into the service of the royal family, eventually becoming the chief martial arts instructor of the kingdom. He is credited with introducing swordsmanship strikes into the kobudo system, as well as passing down several kata.</p>
        <h4>Matsumura Nabe</h4>
        <p>Matsumura Nabe was the grandson of Matsumura Sokon. He was privileged to obtain thorough training form his grandfather, including White Crane techniques that were only taught within the immediate family.</p>
        <h4>Soken Hohan</h4>
        <p>Soken Hohan was the sole student of Matsumura Nabe. He was also the first to open a dojo to the public, under the name "Matsumura Seito Shorin-ryu karate."</p>
        <h4>Kise Fusei</h4>
        <p>Kise trained under Makabe in 1947, Shingake Nobutake in 1955, and finally Soken in 1958. He was awarded 9th Dan by Soken, and started the Shorin Ryu Karate Kenshin Kan Karate and Kobudo Federation. He was promoted to 10th Dan. In 2001, the Government of Japan formally stated that Kise is the sole true heir to Matsumura Orthodox Karate, and thus tge style belongs to him.</p>
        <h4>Kise Isao</h4>
        <p>Kise Isao is the son of Kise Fusei and his designated successor. He has been the All Okinawan Kata, Kobudo, and Kumite Gran Champion multiple years in a row.</p>
