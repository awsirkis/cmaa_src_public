          <p>Dear fellow members of our Karate family-</p>
          <p>This year, we are facing a crisis the likes of which haven't been seen in 100 years. This time, we have the means to fight it by preventing the spread.</p>
          <p>In order to keep everyone in our karate family safe, and in accordance with Governor Inslee's stay-at-home order, we will not be holding class in the dojo. This is to prevent everyone from contracting the virus, due to the close-quarters nature of martial arts increasing the chance of spread.</p>
          <p>We will instead be holding classes online through the <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> video conferencing platform. Classes will be held at the regular times on regular days to promote continuity in training. As the order is adjusted, we may consider meeting in an open public park, however for the time being the only training we can offer is online. You may contact us through the <nuxt-link to="/contact/">Contact</nuxt-link> page to get the link, or for any other reason.</p>
          <p>This is also a convenient opportunity to introduce the Student Resources sections. This is a project that has been in the works for months, and has recently started implementation. All paying students should have received an email from no-replay@verificationemail.com with the subject "Your Cascade martial Arts Academy Account Details." This email contains a username and temporary password that will allow you to access training videos on our site. We are still populating the kata and drill videos, so please expect more than the current selection in the coming weeks. If you have not received an email, first check your spam, then contact <a href="mailto:sempaiadam.cmaa@gmail.com">Sempai Adam</a>, and he will get you squared away.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the landlord has cut rent this month in half, and we are passing that savings on to you. For this month, your monthly dues will also be halved.</p>
          <p>We thank you for your patience in these trying times, and wish everyone to stay happy and healthy.</p>
          <p>Train hard. Ganbatte ne.</p>
