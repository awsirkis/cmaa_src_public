                <h1>Do Karate and Other Traditional Martial Arts (TMA) Work?</h1>
                <p>This is a common question for many new martial artists, and one that experienced martial artists ask themselves at some point. </p>
                <p>There are many videos of traditional martial artists (generally in Chinese TMA such as Tai Chi or Kung Fu) going up against modern MMA fighter s and getting absolutely wrecked. The most famous of these is Xu Xiaodong, who famously challenged all of the TMA practitioners in China to fight him after he realized that CHinese professional MMA was on the same level as Western amateur fighters. There are also many single-style fighters in modern sport styles such as Muay Thai that can essentially play with TMA practitioners. </p>
                <p>If traditional martial arts are worth learning, why do they lose in the ring? Why not learn something more along the lines of boxing, wrestling, or just join an MMA gym? It all comes down to how these practitioners train, how much they train, and what they take away from training.</p>
                <h3>What are the point of katas (and what most people miss)?</h3>
                <p>Kata are a traditional form used in karate to teach the basic moves. Kata originated as a way to prevent other schools from stealing their moves, and were limited to oral tradtition. Modern kata, as seen in the World Karate Federation (WKF)'s Championships, tend to turn into a dance of sorts, where ractitioners do a set of moves without much regard for how they work. Other times, such as in judo or aikido, the kata are two-man drills, but they are done with the expectation of no resistance.</p>
                <p>This was not always the case. Kata were originally taught by having the students attack each other and defend. In this way the kata became a 2-or-3-man drill, where students learned the basics of defense. Cascade Martial Arts Academy runs a hybrid of the two methods, such that the basics are covered by copying the movement, then are solidified by contact. This also builds up the confidence to not flinch when attacked, something that you will see a lot of TMA practitioners do when assaulted by a boxer.</p>
                <h3>What's wrong with the way TMA Practitioners usually train?</h3>
                <p>Many TMA schools train their martial arts only through one-man kata, or in the best case through 2-man cooperative drills. The learners there then expect their opponents to move like in the drills, i.e. fully cooperative, probably slow, almost never following up, probably the sole opponent, and almost certainly unarmed. This is not the way a real fight works. A fight in the street will almost certainly be against multiple opponents, and at least some of them will be armed. It will be chaos, the practitioner will get hit, and their training did not prepare them for it.</p>
                <p>What they should be doing is integrating full-contact sparring into their regimens. At CMAA, we practice full-contact sparring so that when the time comes, we can actually use our fighting against an attacker. We also train partial-contact drills against multiple opponents, some armed, to get used to the idea of dealing with multiple attackers. Karate is a great art for dealing with multiple attackers, as the only way to deal with them is to, one-at-a-time, injure them enough to keep them from re-entering the fight. As karate was built on the idea of disabling an attacker in as few strikes as possible, this fits in nicely.</p>
                <p>The other way that TMA practitioners train wrong is by training 2-4 hours a week and expecting to be a pro fighter in a month. Contrary to what Hollywood would have you believe, you cannot climb a mountain to see a sage and suddenly get martial arts. Just like any other skill, it takes a long time to understand, and an even longer time to do it well. Many bad TMA schools don't allow for adequate time before advancing their students, leading to a false sense of confidence. However, a good TMA school, such as the Shao Lin Temple, can result in great practitioners, as shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqM75eGR98k">here</a>. What makes them different? It's nothing in particular about Shao Lin kung fu, it's instead that they train 8 or more hours a day for years to become a warrior monk, and never get ahead of themselves due to the humility inherent to Buddhism. </p>
                <h3>Why do TMA moves look so weird?</h3>
                <p>Compare the following stances:</p>
                <img alt="image" src="~/assets/img/articles/guards-comparison.jpg">
                <p>What are the differences between them? You'll notice that the older styles have a low-to-mid guard, have one hand way in the back, and have feet much more in-line than the modern boxer. This reasoning has two parts. the first is that the boxers stance and guard, as well as punches, are designed to leverage the fact he has gloves on. The second is that the boxer is the result of decades of worldwide comparison of fighters. International boxing started off looking like English boxing or karate, before people started making changes to it and displaying them on a televised stage for comparison and analysis, eventually ending up in the International Boxing stance. This reflects the two different development processes that went into these styles - one was developed with the idea of fighting in mind, one was developed with the idea of sports in mind. </p>
                <p>In fact, many of the blocks, traps, and kicks present in TMA, and especially karate, can still be seen in modern styles today. </p>
                <h3>If TMA are so good, why do they lose in the ring?</h3>
                <p>Again, it all comes down to the development process. If we recall the origins of karate, it was meant to be an easy way to defend yourself against an attacker, especially against armed ones in a time when commoners weren't allowed to have weapons. TMA moves, when practiced right, are meant to injure and kill. All of that graceful aikido that preaches "winning through peace"? It comes from aikijujitsu, which was well-known for having hellish training that routinely broke bones. Many Japanese TMA have lost their edge due both to the commericialization of it and by the ban on practicing martial arts (budo or jutsu) placed on them after WWII, thus forcing them to turn it into regular excercise (do) to keep the traditions alive. TMA are, at their core, military (martial) arts, making them more ideal for a real fight.</p>
                <p>By contrast, look at MMA, sport Tae Kwan Do, sport Karate, and boxing. These are all <i>sporting</i> arts, meaning that they are designed to be a repatable, entertaining excercise. This means that there are certain rules in place when in the ring, such as no eye-gouges, no limb breaking, no joint breaking, no hard strikes to the head, etc. The biggest difference comes in single-point fighting, such as in Shotokan, sport Tae Kwan Do, or many Judo competitions, where the round is over once a point is scored. By limiting the move sets of TMA practitioners to those only allowed by sporting rules, there is inherently an edge given to the sport practitioner because that's what they've trained with. That's not to say that a TMA practitioner would demolish a sport practitioner on the street - it always comes down to the actual fighter themselves. In fact, if you cram a sport practitioner into a TMA tournament's rules, such as the various Muay Thai vs Kyokushin videos out there, the same advantage now tips towarsd the TMA practitioner, because their full moveset is available, while the sport practitioner is limited. There are advantages to practicing martial arts as a sport - sports focuses more on a balance of skills such as striking, kciing, and grappling, and substituting the time TMA practitioners dedicate to kata (which are, again, practiced wrong elsewhere) with actual fighting is always good. However, to compare a fish and a monkey when the only metric is climbing a tree is an excercise in futility.</p>
                <h3>What should TMA practitioners get out of training to be effective fighters?</h3>
                <p>TMA practitioners should eventually be able to see the moves being done, and take away <i>the principles it shows</i>. It makes very little sense to think that kata, and indeed static drills, are enough to prepare you for fighting if you interpret them as moves. However, if we take a page out of military martial art's book (or if they take a page out of history's), we should see that what we want are principles of fighting, such as "if they punch, block and move out fo the way, then feel an opening for a strike." A real fight is, again, fast-paced and chaotic. The opponent won't wait for you to go, "Oh, we just elarned this in class, Thursday, what was it?" Instead, learn to understand the flow inherent in fighting, and grow to instictually undertsand what you can do at any given situation. Will it take years? Yes! Will it take lots of hard work? Of course! But so does any other skill, and learning to defend yourself is literally a matter of life or death, so why not learn the one that works in the street?</p>
