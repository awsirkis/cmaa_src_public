            <p><b>Official Statement of the OSMKKF regarding the ISMSKF, Jay Gravelle and Greg Lazarus</b></p>
            <p>July 11, 2016</p>
            <p>This statement is made in response to a recently circulated photograph of an ISMSKF member holding a promotion certificate which appears to have Grandmaster Kise's signature on it.</p>
            <p>When the ISMSKF was formed by Jay Gravelle and Greg Lazarus in April of 2015, Grandmaster's support was requested by them and he gave it. Upon subsequent inspection, it was determined that this was not in his, Kaicho's or the OSMKKF's best interest and his support was withdrawn officially 2 months later in June of 2015. This withdrawal of support was official and was final and has been repeatedly verified with Grandmaster by Kaicho</p>
            <p>Grandmaster Fusei Kise, Kaicho Isao Kise, and the OSMKKF (Okinawa Shorinryu Matsumura Orthodox Karate and Kobudo Federation) have no interest in being involved with the ISMSKF, Greg Lazarus or Jay Gravelle as evidenced by the withdrawal of Grandmaster Kise's support. The ISMSKF is the business of Lazarus and Gravelle and their members only and has no connection in any way to Hanshi-sei Fusei Kise, Kaicho Isao Kise or the OSMKKF. Any product bearing a likeness of Grandmaster Kise, Kaicho Isao Kise, or the OSMKKF in their literature, websites, or anywhere else, is unauthorized and is being utilized without permission or consent of any kind. Any certificate issued by the ISMSKF that has Hanshi-Sei Fusei Kise or Kaicho Isao Kise's signature after June of 2015, is unauthorized and is issued without the permission or consent, given or implied, of Grandmaster Kise or Kaicho Isao Kise.</p>
            <p>Any questions regarding this statement should be addressed to John Shipes or Jeff Ader, OSMKKF US Directors.</p>
            <p>Thank you.</p>
            <p>John Shipes, Director<br>
