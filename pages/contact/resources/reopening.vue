          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Spectators, including parents, will not be allowed in the dojo. This is in the interest of maintaining maximum capacity for students. This restriction may be lifted after the first week as Snohomish County moves into Phase III and beyond, or in repsonse to class sizes.</li>
              <li>Please bring your own masks and waterbottles. All other cleaning products, including wipes for gear and hand sanitizer, will be provided.</li>
              <li>Students will clean hands before and after class.</li>
              <li>Students will have their temperatures taken via temporal thermometer upon entrance. Students with temperatures above 38C will be sent home and reccomended to go seek medical treatment.</li>
              <li>Students will use the same equipment (sticks, focus pads, etc) for the duration of each class.</li>
              <li>Students will train with the same partners for the duration of the class.</li>
              <li>Students from the following class will not enter until students from the previous class have exited.</li>
