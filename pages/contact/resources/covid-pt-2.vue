            <h1>COVID Lockdowns Back in Place</h1>
            <p>
                Under new restrictions, in place starting November 18, 2020, Washington State is back under absolute lockdown. This means that we will have to cease indoor operations for the foreseeable future.<br>
                <br>
                This means that, once again, we are moving back to Zoom classes. Please contact Sensei Rick if you no longer have the Zoom link, or if you are a new student who joined after we reopened.
                <br><br>
