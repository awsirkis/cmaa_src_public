                <p>All, I have decided to open the school back up to everyone. We will adhere to masks and social distancing. On an average we never exceed the capacity on any given evening. I feel confident that we will be safe. </p>
                <p>I will open a zoom platform for all classes, just in case you are high risk.</p>
                <p>This will end in the near future as I am planning on going back to full contact as soon as the immunization process is substantially completed.</p>
                <p>So starting Monday (Jan 11, 2021) we will be open. The schedule will remain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monday and Wednesday 6pm Kids Class</li>
                    <li>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday 7pm Adults Class</li>
                    <li>Combatives class on alternating Saturdays. This will change and we will resume having kids on saturdays if it is warranted</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For now the above schedule that i have laid out is effective Monday. </p>
                <p>Sensei Tim and myself will be attending the classes geared up and ready to go there will also be combative components taught  . If you have any questions Please feel free to call me,Text or email.</p>
                <p>Based on current trends, the dojo could be completely reopen for training in 2-4 weeks. If you are not comfortable with contact, we can supplement training with other drills that can be done on your own. Such drills can be found for logged in users under our "Video Resources" page.</p>
